NewsEra is a conversational voice controlled React News Application. You can find latest news by categories, terms and sources. I've used Alan AI to embed the contextual voice assistant into the application UI. It's easy to use and lets you control most of the actions just by your voice.

- [Alan AI](https://alan.app)
- [TheMoviesDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
